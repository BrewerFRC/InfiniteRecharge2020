/**
 * The Magazine sub-system consists of a motor and two ir make/break sensors to manage ball handling.
 * The bottom IR sensor on the Intake side of the magazine will detect when a ball is feed in from the intake.
 * The magazine motor will run to load the ball into the magazine until it is past the sensor.
 * The top IR sensor on Flywheel side of the magazine is used to detect when the magazine is at capacity, as well
 * as detect individual balls being feed into the flywheel, so that a ball is thrown only when the Flywheel is ready
 * (upto rpm).  This also provides a way to shoot individual balls as well stream balls (full automatic), as soon as
 * the flywheel is ready.
 *
 * The magazine can hold upto 5 balls, when loaded tightly together.  It is possible to have less than 5 balls
 * in the magazine and trigger the top sensor.
 * State logic controls the coordination of the motors, sensors and interaction with the Flywheel.  See state logic 
 * for more details.
 *
 * Magazine must be instantiated by the Shooter object, which will provide acces to the Flywheel instance, for status 
 * checking.
 *
 * Run init() when starting the robot and then call update() every robot cycle to drive the state process.
